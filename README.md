# bibletags-widget-script

A lightweight script used to embed [bibletags-widget](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-widget).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This aspect of the Bible Tags project has been placed on hold while focus is given to the React Native app. [More on project phases](https://bibletags.org/phases).**

## Basic information

* Launches the widget in iFrames using postMessage for communication
* Contains no dependencies
* Uglified upon deployment
* Lives on a cdn
* Holds as little logic as possible so as to rarely change, since each change requires an embed tag update

## Development
